# ABC_Company_Employee_Analysis

A Python-based data analysis project on an ABC Company dataset (458 rows × 9 columns). The goal is to analyzes employee data to understand trends in team composition, positions, salaries, age distribution, and employee height.

# Project Overview
- Dataset size: 458 rows × 9 columns
- Focus:comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams.
- Primary Tool:Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, jupiter

# Objectives
- Fix the height
- analyse team distribution, employee segregation based on their positions, predominant age, highest salary and correlation
- visualizing each analysis
- providing insights
  
# Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and prepared to ensure consistency and integrity:
Height Correction

# Analysis Tasks
1. Distribution of Employees Across Teams, Determined the percentage split relative to the total Employee and visualization using barplot that showing employee distribution by team.
2.  Segregation of employees based on their positions and visualization using barplot showing the number of employees in each position.
3.  Determined predominant age group and visualization using piechart of employee age groups. 
4.  Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure and visualization using horizontal bar plot showing salary expenditure across teams and positions.
5.  Investigated whether age correlates with salary,Calculated correlation coefficient and visualization using scatter plot of Age vs Salary with a regression line to highlight trends.
